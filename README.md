## About The Project

In the project, a model is created using various machine learning algorithms and the performance of this model is evaluated.

The following steps were followed in this project:

Data Discovery and Preprocessing: Preliminary operations such as examining the data set and filling or removing missing values were carried out.

Data Visualization and Analysis: Various graphs have been created to explore and visualize the data set.

Model Building: The dataset was trained using machine learning algorithms. Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor were used.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the created models was evaluated and compared.

Final Model Selection: The model with the best performance was selected and made ready for use.
